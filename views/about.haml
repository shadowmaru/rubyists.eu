%p The advent of Internet has ushered a new age for humanity. If we have to paraphrase Charles Dickens, this global information system has begotten “the season of Light” and it has given people the chance to live in “the best of times,” if they manage to harness its immense potential wisely.
%p The phenomenon of globalization, rapidly followed by the spread of regionalization, has transformed the world into a global village. The evolution of internet has further shrunk the geographic boundaries of this village and it has enabled neighbors to become aware of one another, and eventually to connect, form their own communities, and share and exchange information for numerous purposes. In a wider sense, digital bonding and regional integration have given people a sense of belonging to a brand new world, where borders have become extremely fluid.
%p Inspired by the current integration trends, we have decided to create a little hub that brings Rubyists in Europe together. Although there are numerous Ruby User Groups scattered all across Europe, very few of them are aware of one another’s web presence. Such lack of awareness may limit communications, cooperation, and collaboration among Ruby nomads. The Rubyists.eu initiative, however, bravely aims at overcoming the obstacles, which beset the development and the evolution of the Ruby Language in our continent.
%p By joining Rubyists.eu, members can attach an extra layer of visibility to their Ruby groups and respectively, to themselves. Enthusiastic Ruby hackers have the opportunity to join new Ruby communities, share details about their regular group meetups, bring interesting events to the attention of others, announce special presentations, make groundbreaking Ruby advancements, or simply publish your pioneering Ruby projects they are working on.
%p Hopefully, by forging bonds, European Rubyists could foster a sense of belonging to something bigger than their local Ruby community.
