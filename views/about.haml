%p Over the course of the last decade, Internet has managed to take people out of their perfect isolation and parachute them into the digital vortex of absolute communication. It has enabled neighbors to become aware of one another, to connect, to form their own transnational communities, and to share and exchange information for numerous purposes. Naturally, national borders have been reduced to mere speed bumps on the unified information superhighway. Yet, there still are numerous stumbling blocks, which hinder netizens from gaining maximum velocity along the digital roads. Such appears to be the peculiar case of the Ruby communities in Europe. 
%p Although there are numerous Ruby User Groups scattered across Europe, very few of them are aware of one another’s presence. Such lack of realization may limit communications, cooperation, and collaboration among Ruby nomads. Thus, in order to fill in the Ruby void in Europe, we embarked on the sweeping Rubyists.EU endeavor. In its core, this initiative is a free of charge communications platform, which aims at encouraging better communications among Rubyists in Europe. Its brave mission is to promote awareness, enhance assistance, and further boost cooperation and collaboration among individual Ruby hackers and Ruby User Groups in Europe.  Virtually, the Rubyists.EU platform offers a joint adventure, which will bring substantial benefits to the ones who wish to share it. 
%p Indeed, by partaking in Rubyists.EU, members can attach an extra layer of visibility to their Ruby groups and respectively, to themselves. Enthusiastic Ruby hackers have the opportunity to join new Ruby communities or even start their own. Rubyists can share delicious details about their regular group meetups, bring interesting events and conferences to the attention of others, announce special presentations, make their groundbreaking Ruby advancements public, or simply publish the pioneering Ruby projects they are working on. Notably, this interactive environment could greatly impact and even change the lives of all Ruby enthusiasts in Europe. 
%p The Rubyists.EU initiative harbors the grand vision that in time, by forging long lasting bonds, European Rubyists could foster a sense of belonging to something bigger than their local Ruby communities. Hopefully, in the long run, Rubyists.EU could help eliminate the obstacles that prevent the smooth adoption of the Ruby language and it would contribute to the development of a robust Ruby community in Europe. 
%p United we stand out!
